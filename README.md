# Extra

This (troll) idea was born looking at one my friend studying non-stop until lunch or dinner were not ready. She used to study in this way like every day, for this reason we (maybe more me than her) thought together about a solution and here I am with this great idea! She will love me, I already know it. Ciao Deb!
